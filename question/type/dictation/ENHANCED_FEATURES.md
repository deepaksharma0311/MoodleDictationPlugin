# Enhanced Dictation Plugin Features

## Complete Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented all your requested features for the Moodle dictation question plugin:

### 1. Enhanced C-Test Support

**Flexible Gap Marking**
- Uses square bracket notation: `The qu[ick] brown f[ox] jumps ov[er] the la[zy] dog`
- Teachers manually mark gaps for complete control over test construction
- Supports both traditional dictation and C-test styles

**Audio Toggle**
- Enable audio → Dictation mode with playback controls
- Disable audio → Pure C-test mode (text-only)
- Same interface handles both question types seamlessly

### 2. Advanced Display Modes

**Four Display Options:**
1. **Standard**: Traditional blank line `_______`
2. **Length Hints**: One underscore per letter `_ _ _ _`
3. **Letter Hints**: First letter shown `g o _ _`
4. **Partial Word**: C-test style showing first half `go___`

**Implementation Details:**
- Each mode generates appropriate placeholders automatically
- CSS styling adapts to display mode
- Monospace fonts for letter-based modes
- Responsive design for all gap types

### 3. Intelligent Scoring System

**Levenshtein Distance Algorithm:**
```
Word Score = 1 - (Levenshtein distance ÷ max(correct length, student length))
Sentence Score = (Sum of word scores × word lengths) ÷ total correct characters
```

**Features:**
- Individual gap-level percentage scores
- Overall passage score calculated proportionally
- Immediate feedback display after submission
- No cascading errors between gaps
- Fair partial credit for near-correct answers

### 4. Research Export Capabilities

**CSV Export Includes:**
- Student identifiers and attempt information
- Individual Levenshtein scores for each gap
- Correct answers vs student responses
- Total passage/dictation scores
- Audio play counts (for dictation mode)
- Timestamps for all attempts

**Export Format:**
```csv
Student,Attempt,Question,Gap 1,Gap 1 Correct,Gap 1 Score,Total Score,Play Count,Time Created
John Doe,123,Question Name,quick,ick,0.75,0.823,2,2024-12-17 10:30:15
```

### 5. Database Schema

**Updated Tables:**
- Added `displaymode` field for gap display options
- Added `audiofile` field for audio storage
- Proper upgrade scripts for existing installations
- Backward compatibility maintained

### 6. User Interface Enhancements

**Teacher Interface:**
- Gap display mode selector
- Audio enable/disable toggle
- Real-time preview of gap rendering
- Validation for required fields

**Student Interface:**
- Dynamic placeholder generation based on display mode
- Keyboard navigation between gaps
- Audio controls with play limits
- Immediate detailed feedback

## Installation Instructions

### Database Fix (If Needed)
```sql
ALTER TABLE mdl_qtype_dictation_options 
ADD COLUMN audiofile TEXT NULL,
ADD COLUMN displaymode CHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'standard';
```

### File Updates
1. Replace existing plugin files with enhanced versions
2. Update version number triggers automatic database upgrade
3. Clear Moodle caches after installation

## Example Usage

### Dictation Mode
```
Transcript: "The [cat] sat on the [mat]."
Audio: Upload MP3 file
Display Mode: Length hints (_ _ _)
Max Plays: 2 times
```

### C-Test Mode
```
Transcript: "She under[stands] the topic and can expl[ain] it clearly."
Audio: Disabled
Display Mode: Partial word (C-test style)
Max Plays: N/A
```

## Scoring Examples

**Student Response: "kat" for correct "cat"**
- Levenshtein distance: 1
- Max length: 3
- Score: 1 - (1/3) = 0.667 = 66.7%

**Overall Calculation:**
- Gap 1: "cat" (3 chars) → 66.7% → 0.667 × 3 = 2.0
- Gap 2: "mat" (3 chars) → 100% → 1.0 × 3 = 3.0
- Total: (2.0 + 3.0) ÷ 6 = 83.3%

## Technical Features

- Full Moodle 3.10+ compatibility
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Accessibility support (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- Backup and restore functionality
- Multi-language string support
- Performance optimized for large classes

All requested features have been implemented and tested. The plugin provides comprehensive support for both audio dictation and C-test assessments with intelligent scoring and detailed research export capabilities.
