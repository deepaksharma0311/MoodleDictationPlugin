# Quick Fix for Abstract Method Error

If you're getting the error:
```
Fatal error: Class qtype_dictation_question contains 1 abstract method and must therefore be declared abstract or implement the remaining methods (question_manually_gradable::is_same_response)
```

## Solution

Replace the content of `question.php` with the corrected version below, or download the fixed files from this repository.

The error occurs because Moodle's question engine expects specific method implementations that vary between Moodle versions.

## Fixed Files Provided

1. `question.php` - Corrected class inheritance and method implementations
2. `questiontype.php` - Updated to handle file operations properly  
3. `renderer.php` - Fixed HTML generation for gap inputs
4. `edit_dictation_form.php` - Form validation improvements

## Installation Steps

1. Replace existing files with corrected versions
2. Clear Moodle caches (Site administration > Development > Purge all caches)
3. Test question creation

## Compatibility

This version is tested with:
- Moodle 3.10+
- Moodle 3.11+ 
- Moodle 4.0+

The plugin automatically detects your Moodle version and uses appropriate methods.
