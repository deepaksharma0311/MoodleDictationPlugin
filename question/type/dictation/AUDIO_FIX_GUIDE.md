# Audio File Loading Fix

## Problem
Audio files show "Sorry, the requested file could not be found" because the `qtype_dictation_pluginfile` function was missing.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created lib.php
Added the required `qtype_dictation_pluginfile()` function to handle file serving from Moodle's file system.

### 2. Fixed Database Schema
Run this SQL to add missing columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mdl_qtype_dictation_options 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS audiofile TEXT NULL,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS displaymode VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'standard';
```

### 3. Updated File URL Generation
- Fixed `questiontype.php` to generate proper pluginfile URLs
- Updated `renderer.php` to handle both string and moodle_url objects

## Testing Steps

1. Apply database fix
2. Upload plugin files (including new lib.php)
3. Clear Moodle caches
4. Create test question with audio file
5. Verify audio plays correctly

## File Structure Required

```
question/type/dictation/
├── lib.php                    ← NEW: Required for file serving
├── questiontype.php           ← UPDATED: Better URL generation
├── renderer.php               ← UPDATED: Proper audio handling
├── db/
│   ├── install.xml           ← UPDATED: Added displaymode field
│   └── upgrade.php           ← UPDATED: Added upgrade steps
└── version.php               ← UPDATED: Version 2024121700
```

The audio loading issue should now be resolved with the proper pluginfile function in place.
