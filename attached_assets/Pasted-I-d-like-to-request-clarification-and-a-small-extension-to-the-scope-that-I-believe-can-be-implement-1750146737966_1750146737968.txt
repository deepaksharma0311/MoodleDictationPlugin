I'd like to request clarification and a small extension to the scope that I believe can be implemented within the same question type plugin. 
1. Optional Use Without Audio (C-Test Style) 
In addition to audio-based dictation tasks, I would like the plugin to support text-only cloze tasks (C-test style) as an alternative. This would not require a separate module—just an optional setting to skip the audio file. The same interface and logic can be used for both question types. 
To support this, I propose the following shared features for both dictation and C-test modes: 
Brackets used to indicate missing text in the transcript
For example:
The qu[ick] brown f[ox] jumps ov[er] the la[zy] dog.
The bracketed parts would be hidden in the student view and replaced with blanks. 
(Note: In traditional C-tests, the second half of every second word—starting from the second sentence—is deleted. In this plugin, however, teachers will manually mark the missing segments using brackets to allow more flexible and customized test construction.) 
If you have an alternative suggestion for how teachers could mark the text to be hidden (besides brackets), I'm open to using a simpler or more implementation-friendly method. 
Teacher option to enable or skip audio upload
If no audio is uploaded, the question becomes a C-test.
If an audio file is uploaded, the question is treated as dictation. 
Display mode options for the gaps: 
One underscore per missing letter (_ _ _) 
A single standard-length blank (_________) 
2. Placeholders to Indicate Word Length or Hints 
It would be helpful to allow teachers to optionally display hints showing how many letters are missing, or partial hints such as the first few letters for a C-test. For example: 
g o _ _ instead of a single blank (for the C-test question type) 
Full-length hints like _ _ _ _ for a four-letter word (for the dictation question type).  
An example implementation can be seen here:

Could this placeholder style be used as part of the student-facing input field display options? 
Additionally, could you please confirm that the "accuracy" and "word-level difference" features described in your proposal will include: 
Percentage scores (based on Levenshtein distance) at both the individual word/gap level and whole text level 
And that these scores will be displayed to learners immediately after submission? 
For research purposes, please ensure the export includes: 
The Levenshtein score for each gap 
The total passage/dictation score 
Student identifiers
