Here's a detailed outline of the functionality I'm aiming for in Phase 1:
Teachers upload an MP3 audio file using Moodle's file picker.
They paste the transcript of the audio into a textbox.

Teachers select which words to hide — either by clicking on words or by marking them with tags (e.g., [word]) in the textbox.
The plugin generates a dictation question where hidden words appear as input boxes, and the rest of the sentence is shown as context.
Teachers can set a maximum number of times the audio can be played (e.g., once, twice, unlimited). The audio player is then disabled after reaching that limit.
Students listen to the audio and fill in the blanks.
On submission, only the hidden words are scored. Each hidden word is scored individually using normalized Levenshtein distance, calculated as:
Word Score = 1 – (Levenshtein distance ÷ max(correct word length, student input length))
The overall sentence score is calculated as a weighted average:
Sentence Score = (Sum of word scores × correct word lengths) ÷ total characters in the correct sentence
 
This method ensures longer words contribute proportionally more to the final score, avoids cascading errors, and supports fair, partial credit — making it well-suited for language proficiency testing.
Students receive immediate feedback showing which words were correct or incorrect and their overall score.
Teachers can export all student responses and scores in CSV format for research or analysis.
If it helps, I'd be happy to provide a simple mockup or sketch of the interface — but I'm also very open to your team's input on design. I'd be glad to get help refining the UI and making sure the experience is user-friendly for both teachers and students.
To evaluate your proposal alongside others, could you please confirm:
Your estimated cost or hourly rate for this project
The name and background of the developer who would be building the plugin
Whether your team is comfortable developing this under a GPL-compatible open-source license
Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
============
Audio file storage: Moodle-based storage is preferred and should be the default. There's no need to support external URLs at this stage.
Word selection method: Manual tagging will be used. Teachers will define the scoring targets using simple markup (e.g., square brackets).
Feedback display format: Same-page feedback is preferred, ideally with per-word results shown directly after submission.
Regarding the design layout, I don't have a finalized mockup yet, but I'd be happy to collaborate on a clean, user-friendly interface once the core functionality is in place.
I'd also like to propose a small scope expansion. In addition to dictation with audio, I would like the plugin to support C-test items (text completion tasks without audio). A simple toggle to disable audio for these items would suffice. Teachers will define the gaps manually using square brackets, for example:
Dictation: She [went] to the store. (with audio)
C-test: She under[stands] the topic well. (no audio)
The plugin does not need to generate C-test gaps automatically. As with dictation items, it should use Levenshtein distance scoring to allow for partial credit, and it must allow teachers to export both per-gap scores and the total passage score. C-test texts will typically be around 100 words long with 20–25 gaps.
Please let me know if this changes the scope significantly or if you need further clarification. I'm looking forward to working together.
